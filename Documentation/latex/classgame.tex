Construtctor for the game set up the window size and titel, the key repeat disable. sets fps limit at 60 fps. calls a private function called set\-Up\-Walls that prepare the walls that the ball bounce on. it calls set\-Up\-Text, is there to prepare all the texts object this class has. Direct new gui to the meny pointer. It calls a private member function called new\-Game witch alocate dynamicly all the objects in the game. then it calls the public member function execute.

Execute has som diffrent clock/timer to controll the fps will be right.

The main thing about the member function is that it's a while that will continue while window is open, and it checks for events of users/program these events are trigger diffrent viribles to change value.

Then it will call update, update changes the possistions and looks for collitions between objects and check if the that object should be removed.

Then the private memberfunction render is called where it clears the screen and then draws/render the objects positions and display it in the widniow.
